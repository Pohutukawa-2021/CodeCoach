##  CodeðŸ’»Coach

Code Coach is a react-app hoping to create a new way to connect developers. We hoped to create a platform where one can build a mentee and mentor relationship between a junior and senior developer. This is created by students at [EDA](https://devacademy.co.nz/) as a final project to showcase within 1 week.
